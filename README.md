(1) The first commit is for a logistic regressor/neural network written to process a pattern of user input and detect user preferences. This would be extended further to an online learning model, wherein every confirmation/declination of the app's suggestion is taken as a new data point and fed into the optimization algorithm associated with the model. 
(2) The second commit is an Android Studio snippet to generate notifications according to events. In this case, the event would be arriving within a certain radius of a user-input destination, according to GPS.
